# dolfin-flutter-development
The Flutter-based app for the [DOLFIN Project](https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/dolfin).   This is a development application. Interaction with NPEU databases have been removed from sing up and add child pages.

## About

Babies who are born very early, or who suffer poor blood supply or lack of oxygen to the brain before or around birth, are more likely to have problems with their brain development and child neurological development. This may affect how children think and learn, communicate, play, and interact with the world around them.

DOLFIN aims to answer the research question:

In babies who are born very early or who suffer poor blood supply or lack of oxygen to the brain before or around birth, does giving a nutritional supplement daily for a year improve long-term cognitive development?

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The application uses Flutter.

* The instructions for installing Flutter on various platforms are [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).
* Instructions for configuring VS Code are [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/vs-code). 

These include instructions for installing and configuring the Flutter SDK and Android Studio, including setting up a device emulator.

The project expects environment variables stored in a `.env` file saved at the project root. See `.env.example` for details of what is required.

### Firebase Setup

To get the app to work correctly with Firebase:

* **Android** - download google-services.json for the app on Firebase and copy it to the "android/app" folder.

### Debugging the App (Android)

Once Flutter, Android Studio and VS Code are installed and configured, you can run the app on the Android device emulator. The Android Emulator should appear in the list of available devices in VS Code and, once selected, can be run with "Run -> Start Debugging" (or F5).

### Debugging the App (iOS)

### Installation

#### Android

#### iOS

```
fastlane match development
fastlane match appstore
pod install
bundle install
flutter build ipa
bundle exec fastlane beta
```

### Running Tests

How to run tests on your local system.

## Deployment

### Local

Deploying to a production style setup but on the local system. Examples of this would include `venv`, `anaconda`, `Docker` or `minikube`. 

### Production

Deploying to the production system. Examples of this would include cloud, HPC or virtual machine. 

## Usage

Any links to production environment, video demos and screenshots.

### Regenerating the Icons
The base icon image is specified in `pubspec.yaml` and the relevent dependencies should be installed automatically.
To regenerate the icons (for Android and iOS), edit the master image file and then use the following commands:

```
flutter pub get  
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
```
